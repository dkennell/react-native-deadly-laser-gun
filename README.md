## React Native Deadly Laser Gun
This is a very scary and frightening laser gun built with React Native. I built it to learn how to play audio in a react-native app. 

### Installation

1. Download the `expo` app onto your phone if you don't have it already. Expo is a shell/wrapper for react-native apps that allows you to run in-development apps on your mobile device.
2. Go to https://exp.host/@dkennell/react-native-deadly-laser-gun and select "open in Expo"
3. Use dealy laser gun. Be careful, don't point it directly at anyone.
